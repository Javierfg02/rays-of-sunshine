# Rays of Sunshine

# Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Set the working directory to "rays-of-sunshine"
3. To run the program with a specific scenefile, supply the name of
    the scenefile. The input scenefile should be stored in ':/scenefiles/inputs/'.
    For example, to run with "cube.json", I would input \<cube\> as an argument into the program
4.  Upon clicking the "save image" button in the UI, the ouput will be saved to
    ':/scenefiles/outputs/\<input file name\>.png' unless a
    a second optional argument is supplied to modify the file name. For example, if my arguments are 'cube cube_normal'
    the program will take input from ':/scenefiles/inputs/cube.json' and write to output ':/scenefiles/ouputs/cube_normal.png'.
